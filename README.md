# Overview

RPG Generator is a fun little side project (one of many) I've been making, so don't expect too much activity. The main idea is that anyone can easily make a text file
and input it into the program to create their own, little text-based adventures!

# Demo

The files include "demo.txt", which showcases all the current build's features. Reading it while playing encouraged!  
To make your own projects, either specify a path or put it in the projects folder.
