# Overview

RPG Generator is a fun little side project (one of many) I've been making, so don't expect too much activity. The main idea is that anyone can easily make a text file
and input it into the program to create their own, little text-based adventures!

# Demo

The files include "demo.rpg", which showcases all the current build's features. Reading it while playing encouraged!  Also, there's "demo.start", which is the start file that dictates what your starting stats will be (it must share a name with the .rpg file)
To make your own projects, either specify a path or put it in the projects folder.

# Contributing

If you are feeling generous to help me out, feel free to! All the stuff that needs doing is in the TODO issue, contact me for any questions or concerns.

# Contact

My contact email is duhontheguy@gmail.com, but you can also contact me on Discord under the username duhon (If your friend request is declined, go for the email,
I might have confused you with spam).

# Activity

Currently this project is ~~in my backburner, as I have so many irl things to work on, plus I am trying my best to not get burned out of code (again), so this project and many others are just going to have to wait a couple of weeks. I will still review and merge pull requests, though, so feel free to work on it!~~ **NOT** in my backburner, as I'm developing it further, and also planning to make it into a Discord bot. Feel free to contribute!
