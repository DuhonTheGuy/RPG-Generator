-Hello! Welcome to RPG Generator!
-To get started, write a file similar to this and specify the path!
-The keywords used are "-" for lines of text, "+" for player input, and "#" for variable editing/creating, just name the variable first if you want to modify it, if it doesn't exist, it will be created!
-You can mix inputs and variables, too! Just put "+" after the variable name, like this:
#variable=+This input will be printed:
#-variable
/To stop text until enter is pressed, just use "/" at the start of a sentence!
-You can also use variables for math! Just put "math." after declaring it!
#variable=math.2+5
-2+5:
#-variable
